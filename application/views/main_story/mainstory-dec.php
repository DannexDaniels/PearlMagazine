					<p><strong>Just like a flower I have opened up. I am blossoming, for God’s plans for me are perfect. Even if I have to wait, I count it all joy because He will make the wait worth it!</strong></p>

							<p>A couple of minutes to twelve, a lady in jungle green water fall sweater, smiling walks in. Her hair almost made me green with envy. The good lady was kind enough to tell me she had complimented her natural hair with Marley hair from her diva hair collection. We sit down and make our order. She is the Amani you have seen on TV, but she is nowhere close to what you see or imagine. She is bigger and better. Ladies and gentlemen allow me to introduce you to the brand-new Amani.</p>
							<p>I quickly ask about her previous song bon, how the sound and even the feel of the song. The answer she gives changes the whole direction of our conversation. The old girl we knew, is no longer in her, there has been a rebirth. There is a new girl blossoming in her.  “Bon was the last one, while shooting it, I just knew it was going to be my last song. I just felt a conviction. I knew it was time to close that chapter. To leave it all behind and flip the page. A new lease of life.”</p>
							<p>Her journey through salvation did not start yesterday, she has always been saved. She walked away from all the fame and money easily without blinking. “I no longer felt comfortable in that environment. It wasn’t coming from a real place. I couldn’t fake it even if I tried. I went through a transition period. I went to Bible School to refresh my relationship with God. It was a process, even now it still is. Every single day God is working on something in my life. The Bible goes further to say, work on your salvation with fear and trembling. I am working on it. It’s not perfected in one day.”</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					
					<p>Amani for a long time kept her salvation private. This was to protect herself from all the pressure from outsiders that come with them knowing you have chosen to walk with God henceforth. “I don’t want to be put under a microscope, be scrutinized and condemned. I want to grow in my own space. I want to know God at my own time. I don’t want to post up a picture of me on Instagram smiling and get people saying there is nothing Godly about my smile. People are good at pointing fingers. Many people enjoy when you are wallowing in the same boat with them. When you leave, you burst their bubble and that becomes a problem.  They don’t have a person to compare themselves to and feel better about themselves anymore.”</p>
					<p>The journey has been a beautiful experience. Her life has changed. Her knowledge of God has increased 1000 folds. A new life has been unfolding right in front of her eyes and she is loving it. “I am a much happier person. Before I was playing an act, you have to act and behave like you are cool and maybe that’s not how you are feeling. Now, am at a more real place. God is revealing himself to me. The most important revelation is that human beings are multi-dimensional. Thing is, when I wasn’t born again, all I thought there was to me was music. I didn’t think about other things I could be. When I began knowing God, I realized the other passions that lie within me. Salvation pushed me to venture into other things that I had pushed aside in my life that I liked doing.”</p>

							<p>From passion, diva hair collection was born. A baby that is a year old. It’s taking slow but steady steps. Determined to grow and change the story of African women and their hair experience. “Hair was always my side hustle and I decided to make it my full-time job. The planning stage took 2 years.  I did my research and I strategized on how I would get into the market and curve my niche. I worked with a couple of stylists to get the market’s reaction of our product. The feedback gave me the green light. The market reception of my product has henceforth been amazing. Our clients keep coming back for more! </p>
							<p>Is there any personal attachment to the brand you might wonder? “Weaves and chemicals had yanked the back of my hair out. Here I am before a concert, tracking the back of my hair, leaving the front. I had a sore that wasn’t healing. I tried everything, it wasn’t working. My hair stylist suggested we try crochet. It wasn’t heavy on the scalp. It would give the wound time to heal and the scalp an allowance to breath. Crochet helped me grow my hair back and I wondered how many women had gone through the same or worse and needed help? We came up with the idea of crochet. Secondly, I wanted something I could blend with my natural hair. Problem is, the other braids are too silky, two weeks down the line, your natural hair is sticking out. So, we carefully selected the Marley braid that blends well with natural hair.”</p>

					<p>Startup capital is always a challenge to many people. Many have brilliant ideas but execution becomes a real problem since there is no money or there is not enough cash to start out. This is what Amani says, “Start where you are at. Build yourself up. The most important thing is progression. The little you have saved, start up. Don’t despise humble beginnings. They are your ladder up. Sometime we want a miraculous investor to invest in our business. But, we have to be accountable with the little we have so that we can be entrusted with more.”</p>
					<p>We live in an age where success stories are very inspirational but far from realistic to the common people. Comparison kills…do not compare your journey to another person’s journey. Instead, look for those who have walked the same journey as yours and find inspiration from their success story. “More and more stories of real startups need to be told. Stories of people who started from the ground with absolutely zero and have become heroes. I know a guy who has three boutiques in Westland’s. How did he start up? Selling mitumbas along the streets. Now he is inside malls with shops. I appreciate stories that use 3 million or 10 million start up because different businesses have different models. Identify which model works for you and start up right way.”</p>

							<p>Among the biggest challenges of doing business is having the patience to wait and watch your business grow and maximize its full potential. “I have had to constantly remind myself a million times that it takes time.  You have this big dream, vision and ambition for your brand and business. It takes time. I have studied a lot of Kenyan businesses such as <em>Darling</em> and <em>Centro Foods</em>. Some of these companies go way back, 10 or even 20 years ago. It would be unrealistic for me and you to start today and want to be where they are. Be patient, it takes time. Go through the process, the process in turn builds character.”</p>
							<p>It is important to take stock of the small wins. Remember, it’s the small picture that acts as a solid foundation when the big picture becomes blurred. “I have positioned all the good things that have happened to me in different parts of my house. They remind me of how far I have come and give me the strength to keep pushing for more. When am taking coffee, I look at one and say to myself, that happened! In my office, the bedside, literally everywhere. Our visuals are very powerful. As a Christian, I have also surrounded myself with scriptures to keep myself going.”</p>
							<p>Women have always been accused of never supporting their fellow women. Amani tells a different tale. “It’s so fantastic to see girls supporting girls. As a start up, you have your own doubts. You wonder if you are good enough a million and one times. To see Kambua order the hair and come back over and over again is very heart warming. Apart from her, many girls have supported me including Mayonde, Michelle Ntalami and my stylist J Praise. She has particularly embraced it and uses it on her clients. It has been a humbling experience.”</p>

					<p>As we wind up the interview, one thing is clear, this girl is all about God. She has buried herself deep in Him and allowed him to be the light on her path and guide her footsteps in whatever it is she does. She finishes by saying all you need to do is let go and let God in whatever it is you are doing; to the glory and honor of His name. She quotes the book of Ephesians 3:20-21 that says, “Now unto Him that is able to do exceedingly and abundantly above all that we ask and think, according to the power that worketh in us, unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus, throughout all ages, world without end. Amen.”</p>

					<center><p><strong>Amani's Nuggets of Wisdom</strong></p></center>
					<ol>
						<li>God created you to function in your purpose. You are not here to pass time. That purpose is what gives you an edge. It’s what makes you the best among the rest.</li>
						<li>God is faithful. What makes you doubt God is when you are thinking; He will not come through for you. When you are sure that He is faithful, you walk and talk in confidence, you know that He is going to come through for you.</li>
						<li>God is a loving God. He compensates for everything He has made you wait for. It comes in double portion, triple or even four times. It comes through in a bigger, better and double way. Habakkuk 2:3 says, ‘even though it may tarry, wait for it, it will happen.’</li>
						<li>God takes time to build your character so that when your blessings and portion come, they last an eternity.</li>
						<li>My Salvation is my personal journey and relationship with God. It does not matter what people say about me or how they perceive me. What’s most important to me is what God is saying about me.</li>
						<li>The bible gives me strength, hope and keeps me going. The word of God does not return to Him void. It is life and it is living.</li>
					</ol>
