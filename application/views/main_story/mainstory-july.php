							<p>Every time you see her on the screens, she’s mostly dressed in hues of blue, her favorite color. She is super stylish, with a warm smile and bubbly personality. She has come from far, deep down she is a fighter. Her whole life has been a battle field and this girl still has her gloves on and is standing tall in the ring. She is not afraid of rematches, after loosing balance she braces herself for impact determined to remain standing afterwards.</p>
							<p>While on my way to do this interview, I make a list of normal questions for the interview, little did I know it was going to be a deep conversation filled with tears (I cried all through while she smiled) and self reflection. Dressed in her favorite color and wonderful blush that stands out beautifully, she smiles and we chime into the conversation.</p>
							<p>She got diagnosed with liver cancer in 2013. It has been a tough journey but she has learnt to embrace the journey and learn from it. “According to Louis Hays, liver cancer is as a result of bottled up emotion and anger. It’s a consequence of peented emotions. I got diagnosed with liver cancer in 2013, it has been a battle of pain, loss, finding my footing again and growth. I had pilled up so much in me and it affected me. The cancer was a wake up call for me to do a lot of forgiving, forgetting and letting go. Through the whole process to date I have learnt invaluable lessons about life,” she says.</p>

					<p>Anjlee has gone through so much pain through her journey. To her, pain is a shift in the state of mind. It teaches you to vie life differently. It opens up your consciousness to things that you might have taken for granted. “I have gone through so much physical and emotional pain through this whole process. From the transplant to the infections that came about due to surgery. I was receiving my treatment in India away from home and my children. The chemotherapy was no joke. Through the pain, I found out how resilient I was. There was innate and infinite strength that I discovered. After the surgery, I went through so much pain and I thought I was going to die but here I am. I have also learnt that pain teaches you a lesson. If you refuse to learn the lesson, you will find yourself in a more painful situation until you learn whatever it is the universe intended to teach you.”</p>
					<p>In the beginning the cancer took a toll on her. She almost lost her balance. To her, its okay to feel lost in a tough situation. From loosing yourself, you strive to find yourself and your way. Henceforth, your life will have a sense of direction. “I went into a state of depression and even hate and anger. But I have learnt that I am in control; total control of my body. Once you realize you that you can take charge. You have the power to tell your body to take a break and think things through. You have the power to decide what you want or who you want to be. Stay positive, and ensure you are in a positive mindset. If you control that, nothing around you will break you.”</p>

							<p>Many people feel like a death bell has been rung when tragedy strikes. Instead of taking a moment to reflect and plan on how to tackle the problem, we probably shift to worst case scenario mindset and slowly we begin crushing. “If you call out for help it will come to you. The definite thing is that most of the time we just don’t realize it. When tragedy strikes we shift into panic mood, STOP. For you its cancer, another is HIV and AIDS, another is a rocky marriage, financial crisis amongst others. Each one of us is going through something. Appreciate your journey and embrace it.”</p>
							<p>One might wonder how some people do it. They have the ability to rise up despite the heavy burden trying to pull them down. On the contrary, you feel tired, every time you try pushing you feel like you are crushing in the process. Anjlee has been there. “There is an innate ability in every single person to survive any experience they go through in life. God will not give you something you can’t handle. It all happens for a reason. You’ll find strength while going through it. You learn from the pain, the tears, the sweat and the blood. You learn how to be patient and appreciate your own journey. The tears wash your eyes for a clear vision and gives you a sense of direction,” she says.</p>
							<p>Anjlee feels like in this current day and age, life has taken over people rather than people taking charge over life. Who are you? We live in a world of fake imperfection and we enjoy it forgetting that the body is just flesh, it’s a vehicle. On the outside we flourish, but in the inside we are empty shells. That is why many people come down crushing at a high speed. “I have found myself deep within. I have disengaged myself from my body and I have focused on growing and feeding my soul. Thanks to social media, we have become selfish. We live in a bubble, chasing perfection. We all want big cars, big houses and we have forgotten about soul food. I found a pranic healing school in the midst of my confusion and I have found my self. It’s a process that helps you heal yourself from deep down. You look deep down in you and ask yourself what is it that I am going through, why am I going through it and what can I learn from it? Make it a reflective process and learn from it.”</p>
							<p>A testing time reveals the true colors of people. You get to find out who are your genuine friends and who are not. Along the way, it’s natural for you to grow and change and this change also prompts change in regards to those you relate with. “Its natural that when you start a journey you have a whole pack behind you, but along the journey and even towards the end you don’t necessarily finish with those people. The universe is well structured, everything happens strategically. You need to ask yourself in your current situation; what is the role of those who surround you? Be selective of who you let in. try and pick out qualities in an individual. If it is negative and toxic, cut it off.”</p>

					<p>Many at times, it’s easy to let a friend run an errand for you and you trust them. How about total surrender to God? In tough times, instead of surrender many of us wear their boxing gloves and instead of fighting end up taking heavy blows. “Stop trying doing it on your own. Give it up to the universe to help. Let go and let God. It is very difficult to get to a state of vulnerability. It takes a crushed ego to let go. Most of the time we are proud and egocentric and enjoy being in control. Even when we are not, we try so hard. Until it slips through you, you’ll keep trying but the day it knocks you down and crushes you, you are left on your knees with nothing. That is when you look up, and call for help. You get purified, the pride and the ‘I’ mentality is gone, that is when help smiles your direction. </p>
					<p>When I was in India, I once went to the temple and I was tired; of chemotherapy, of being away from home, of fighting. I broke down and let go. Later on after about 3 hours of painful chemotherapy, I told my husband I wanted to go to Calcutta the next day. The moment I stepped on the pilgrims my pain vanished and henceforth none of my chemotherapy sessions was painful. I have made it a point to go to very spiritual places I can to ask for one thing; my health. It is God that gave me life, only Him can take it away from me, nothing else.”</p>
					<p>Cancer has opened Anjlees eyes to her surrounding and has taught her the art of gratitude. She has learnt to look at things with a price tag differently and learnt to attach value to priceless things. “Appreciate every single thing in life. Our gratitude is so little. We take so much for granted. Start projecting inner gratitude and everything disintegrates and there will be no room for darkness. It’s a brand new day, you’ve seen a sunset, you have shoes, clothes, food, shelter, family and perfect health. Stop attaching value to materialistic property. It will never be enough. It’s a constant chase that never ends. Start appreciating the priceless things. Life in itself and all it has to offer. I take my shoes off and enjoy stepping on the grass, opening the curtains in the morning and smiling at the sunrise. Know when to stop. Hustle will be there has been there. Hustle has stolen our lives…We are trapped in a golden cage of materialism. We feel trapped but truth is we are comfortable bit we have forgotten that the gate is right there in front of us. Take a moment laugh and enjoy life, stop setting standards for happiness, if you can’t laugh at a silly joke, if you can’t appreciate simplicity its time to check yourself and reflect.”</p>

					<p>This brave girl has come to appreciate that doctors and medicine can do so much but true healing begins with oneself and is done by one. You have the ability to bring back your health be it mentally, spiritually, physically and even emotionally. “Sadhana: service. How do you learn to appreciate yourself and life? When you are able to meet the less fortune and leave a positive impact in life. Master Chao says 10% tithe, 20% save the rest spend. Whatever you sow you reap. Service brings a reflective sense of one self. Spend time in places with divine outpour. That is a positive energy you are channeling into yourself. Go to places where there is positive energy you can tap into. That is how healing begin. But the primary healing step is forgiveness. Learn to forgive yourself and those that hurt you and forget and genuinely bless people. It’s a full thorough detox in your system.”</p>

							<p>One might help but wonder how did Anjlee deal with the fear of loosing her life and even her two beautiful daughters? According to her, fear steals your life away, face your fear and live each day to the fullest. “I have fears too. I have lived in fear but I have conquered my fear because nobody knows tomorrow. The odds are way beyond our comprehension. Death is creepy and in an eye blink everything can be taken away from you. A person battling cancer will have everyone thinking they ate dead and a perfectly healthy normal individual passes on leaving the cancer patient fighting on. What are the odds? I lost my health, my life and wealth. I had lost peace. To break that vicious cycle took a lot of pain to realize am on a different path. I stopped comparing myself to others and my journey begun unfolding itself to me and everything made sense to me. I am no longer scared of death, I make the best out of everyday, trying to serve my purpose. To me, death is an opportunity to evolve, a time for my soul to get elevated to a better place.”</p>
							<p>After every battle there is a scar to remind you of what you went through but came out alive. Many people have scars that they are ashamed of, but not Anjlee.  “I have scars all over my body. They tell my story of how much of a fighter I am; how I have conquered everything that has been thrown my direction. There was a time I was conscious and covered them. I have gone through over a total of seven surgeries. It just hit me that I need to stop being conscious about the scars because nobody will notice. I have learnt to wear them with the same grace I wear my clothes with. Wear your scars with confidence, you know what happened to you, don’t hide it and embrace your journey.”</p>

					<p>As a mom that has been through hell and back, her perception on parenting has changed. “I hope my daughters grow up and make a difference in a society. I hope up they grow up having each others back growing through life knowing they have each other. I love my daughters and I pray I see them grow into women of dignity and honor.”</p>
					<p>Anjlee has learnt to live each day like its golden. She has mastered the art of self love and appreciation. “Every time I look into the mirror, I am reminded that I am a strong beautiful child of God, divinely protected and divinely loved.”</p>
