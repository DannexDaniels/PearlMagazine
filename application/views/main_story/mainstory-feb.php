            <p><b>Senator Daisy Kanaidza Nyongesa, the lioness roaring in the senate on behalf of the youth, a staunch believer, passionate about community development, full of life and optimistic about a better tomorrow.</b></p>
            <p>At only 27, daisy has so much under her belt. Her soft spoken nature and humility can easily mislead one into thinking otherwise about her but she is full of life, hardworking and very assertive. For an interview slotted at four to start at six meant she had to stretch more hours into meetings. Donning her party t-shirt, she was meeting women delegates in her party to work on a strategy that will help reinforce the party’s agenda and enable them win the next general election and at around six it we begun the interview.</p>

            </div>    
        </div>
          <p>Born and bred in the village, daisy had a normal village girl childhood from attending to house chore to fetching firewood and water in the river. Digging, planting and other farm duties were no exception too, she had it all covered and still balanced it out well with her education. She attended a village primary school where every Friday they had to take to school cow dung to smear their classes’ smooth, a Jerri can of water and firewood meant to cook for class eights.</p>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg-4">
            <p>Daisy’s leadership journey begun in primary school, when she was elected the class representative. Upon completing her primary education, she proceeded to Moi girl’s high school Nangili. Though it was not her school of choice, financial constraints left no other choice. There, she also served as a student leader. High school for her was fun thanks to her principal who made education fun and promoted sisterhood in the school. </p>
            <p>After high school, she joined Egerton University to do short courses before joining Masinde Muliro University of science and technology to study English but that was not what she truly desired to study deep down. “I always wanted to be a doctor and so I applied for a three year diploma course at Mukumu nursing teaching center but the thought of three years doing a diploma yet a degree course is just a year short made me resort to studying English since i had personal time deadlines to beat.” </p>
            <p>Her interest in politics developed during the 2005 referendum. “During that time, the chungwa revolution was all up in the air and we were given a break from school to go home during the voting period, and there and then I was stuck on politics and thus my motivation in campus. Our campus lot had a leadership council that comprised of many first years.” </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-4">
            <p>She was the gender police in campus lobbying for gender equality and pushing for its actualization during events that required representations of both genders. Her breakthrough came in 2010 during the referendum where she was picked as one of the youth representatives from her college. “ That opportunity gave me a window to read and understand the constitution well and travel all over the country lobbying for support for it which put me in the heart of most of the action and enabled me exploit my potential.” In 2011 her party held grass root elections where she was elected the secretary general to the county a position she served dully and diligently. She was always on the forefront of many party events which gave her recognition nationwide among her party members and as a reward, her party sponsored her to go attend the program for young politicians Africa which had participants from all over the continent and international trainers to sharpen her leadership skills.</p>
            <p>Her nomination to the senate came as a surprise as she did not see such a huge breakthrough so soon. “My name and another party’s member name were forwarded and I buried myself deep in prayer asking God to make a way for me. Despite the fact that many people discouraged me, I fixed my eyes on God and got encouraged by my parents and when it was time, I was nominated since the other guy did not qualify on the age merit, he was above thirty five years old.” </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-4">
            <p> At 23, she joined the senate, a house she enjoys being in and rubs shoulders with colleagues she holds with high regard. “The senate is a very orderly house because of the maturity and experience of the senators. I have learnt so much from them on politics and they have taught me good life skills lessons”</p>
            <p>Her leadership position has enabled her transform the society through various community driven initiatives she runs through her salary. Under her name Daisy nyongesa is community resource center in Kakamega County, a community library. “Back in the day, difficult to even get a newspaper in my village, when I got nominated and my name was on the paper, we spent hours looking for a newspaper and there and then I knew something had to be done. The center is meant to offer books to the society to read but the reception was amazing and the bracket of those who visit the library cuts across the board that we have had to create a program on study hours to decongest the library. The amazing thing is that even when children are sent home for fees, instead of going home they visit the library and study. With the growing numbers day in day out, we are working on expansion in terms of space and material for the betterment of tomorrow’s society.” She also runs ‘Somesha Toto’ which provides students with sanitary towels, uniforms, stationery, and runs and anti-jigger campaign that sees them treat infected children and offer them shoes among a myriad of other projects geared towards making the world a better place.</p>

            <p>Her love and dependence on God can be felt through the whole interview as she does not go for a minute without giving God the glory for she has achieved.  So I ask where her love for God comes from,“ I was raised in a Christian family to pastor parents. My mom is a prayerful woman who is always in constant prayer for her children. Every morning she sends all her children prayer text messages. I followed suit all the way from Sunday school singing Christmas and New Year carols in church, to praise and worship in high school and even campus. During school holidays my parents would sponsor my siblings and I to the youth church camp to spend our holiday there.” Well according to her Christianity is real and living in a world with so many temptations and battles if anyone focuses on God, He fights their battles.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg-4">
            <p>Her love for life shines through her face, through it all she has learnt that the greatest gift one can ever give you is love. She loves herself and has surrounded herself with people who truly love her which saw her walk down the aisle on the 14th of august 2015 to her husband Edward Kiyondi at the Consolata shrines in Westland’s. “If there is anyone in this world who is so protective of me is my husband but in the most loving and caring way. My job has never come in between us, I notify him in advance of my plans and we work things out. I try spending as much time at home as possible and being a luhya woman I cook for him, pamper him and treat him like a king at home. Also my children give me life, just like any other parent I work hard so that I can give them the best but I am also careful to instill discipline in them” She goes ahead to point out that God has played an instrumental role in her marriage and her openness since she did not conceal her true identity or pretend to be who she is not. She further urges women to stay happy in their unions but if one is not maybe on abuse grounds, pack your bags.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-4">
            <p>But if one thinks her life has been a bed of roses then they are dead wrong, she has gone through her fair share of pain. “My name has been dragged to the mud on various accounts and the attacks go way beyond belief. Mean and nasty things have been said about me even online malicious people rallying other to soil my name and all that comes with my tangle with politics. Some of those things hurt because I am a human being but I have learnt to let go and let God. Sometimes also there are projects I work on and God tests my patience and I even get emotional but still in Him I find strength to keep forging ahead.”</p>
            <p>While her intentions of whether to vie or not in august are not clear, the work she has done and the life she leads plays an instrumental role in motivating and inspiring the younger generations. As we finish off the interview she urges women to support each other stating there is judgment for those who will not.</p>
