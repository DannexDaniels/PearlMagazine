        <p>Imagine growing up in a children’s home or in the streets and later in life stumbling upon a picture of a younger you in the internet in a large crowd of well-dressed young people smiling while you are the only one in tattered clothes and looking malnourished with a caption “#servicetohumanity”.</p>
        <p>Life is an interesting journey. We have a society made of the haves and haves not and it is very amazing that the haves are really enthusiastic and willing to make a difference by offering a helping hand where possible. My friend Lovine Mboya vloged on Millennials and Volunteering; Yay or Nay? Where she was keen to talk about the volunteer experience and the types of organizations one can volunteer for.  Well it is quite interesting how young people have committed to make the world a better place.</p>

<p>In this digital error where our fingers are always itching to be the first ones to post live in our timelines, we snap, tweet, gram literally everything. The young millennials have unfortunately taken it upon themselves to take a video or picture of every act of kindness they take up. Pictures are important, they make up our memories. But is it really important to let the left hand know what the right hand did? Many may argue that It’s for future receipts and accountability purposes but in most cases there are always designated photographers to take up that role. </p>

        <p>I’ve had the privilege of working with my peers in different volunteer projects and even lead at some point and it’s sickening the kind of social media craze associated with any charity event. Volunteers will be busy on their phones taking pictures of anything and snapping everything and the worst part is they prefer capturing moments with the most destitute of all. They forget the main purpose of volunteering and in a crowd of 20 only 5 are working the rest are busy “making memories”. Take an example where you are visiting a children’s home to spend the day with the children of course there is division of duties we are 20 volunteers but then you find two are cooking two are cleaning three are engaging the children, one is the designated photographer for the team and the rest are on their phones updating status and posting on a social media pages with funny #s that make themselves look like the best thing that ever happened to humanity.</p>

<p>Do we as the young generation take time to reflect on the impacts of the posts and the wording associated to it on the people or children we help in the future? The internet doesn’t forget. What we caption, will it make them appreciate their humble homes and upbringing or make them feel like children of a lesser god.  At the end of it all we stand to be counted by our presences and the several pictures we took there, but do we really have the fulfillment of touching a life and making a difference?</p>
<p>Next time you planning on being a volunteer or attending a charity event kindly remember to leave your camera at home and actually help out in achieving the purpose of the mission. Do not let the left hand know what the right hand has done and in its own way the universe strikes a balance for rewarding our good deeds. </p>
