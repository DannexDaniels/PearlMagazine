          <p>It's already. 12 noon and Mike is yet to call. Unlike most of the normal Sundays, today he left a bit earlier apparently his girlfriend had called not feeling well which I am sure was a fake. There is a lot I put up with but definitely not this abrupt exit after a mind blowing sex session.</p>
          <p>Excuse me for glorifying "cheating" but Mike is still my Boyfriend who as fate would have already, has a girlfriend. I would pass as a "side dish" in your opinion but who cares anyway RIP morality! The ratio of men to women is unbalanced and if our smart selves don't find a way of coexisting then we just might end up the old bitter grandma's who had to lead a lonely life to their old age.</p>
          <p>I met bae in one of the after-party's after an amazing win for the tritons and we became the unusual party that kicks it off after a one night stand not for money not for fame not for sex but purely out of love. Mike was bold enough to let me know on our first date that he was already in a serious relationship and gave me the liberty to decide if I’ll be comfortable sharing my man which I didn’t mind as long as he comfortably provides and treats me right.</p>
          <p>Our bae seems to have it all. The country's best footballer, two adorable women he loves and who love him back as his support system, what more can a man ask for in life?  I tend to be more outgoing unlike the reserved Aida who is more of a <em>"fala shtuka"</em>  which is why I tend to assume the trophy position and accompany him to most of the weekends getaways.</p>
          <p>Does Aida know about me? That I don't know but on my guess it tends to be more fun when it's sneaky and that’s what adds to my worry.. Should I call him? Aida lives just three hrs away from my place, He left at 7 and by now he should have arrived two hours ago. He calls me all the time and I've never bothered to find the appropriate time to give him a call for any reason.</p>
          <p>My mind wanders imagining all the possible horrible things that could have befallen bae until I decide to make the first call, and a feminine voice answers "Hello... Hello" it's Aida.</p>
