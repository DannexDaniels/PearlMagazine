        <p><span id="ans">ANNE: </span>I'm Princess Anne Kageha, a born again Christian. I just graduated from Maasai Mara University on 1st December 2017 with a Bachelor's degree in Education Arts with Special Needs Education. I'm yet to start my masters in SNE (Mentally Challenged) in the course of this year. </p>
        <p><span id="quiz">PMA: </span><b>What genre of music do you do and what's the inspiration behind it?</b></p>
        <p><span id="ans">ANNE: </span>I do reggae gospel and worship songs. My inspiration is drawn from the things God does for me. I believe God deserves all the glory and I glorify Him through my music.</p>

        <p><span id="ans">ANNE: </span>Well, it hasn't been a walk in the park. I've gone through hurdles. I am not saying this because everyone else does, nope. I first did these songs on 22nd September 2016. I have been duped off my money but with time I have become smarter. I am slowly learning the business of music and building my ministry.</p>

<p><span id="quiz">PMA: </span><b>So currently what are you working on and what are your future plans in the music industry?</b></p>
<p><span id="ans">ANNE: </span>I am working on releasing a video for one of the songs from my already debuted album which is available on all online music platforms. In future I intend to synchronize the production of audios and videos.</p>
<p><span id="quiz">PMA: </span><b>As a young gospel artist, what are some of the challenges that you have gone in the industry? </b></p>
<p><span id="ans">ANNE: </span>Funding the whole music production budget has not been easy. So far, I have been depending on my savings from the pocket money my mom would give me. Either way I keep pushing knowing better days are ahead and that God will provide as stated in Isaiah 45:2. There are those who will also try and discourage me from doing music but I have fixed my eyes on God and I trust Him to lay a table for me in the presence of my enemies.</p>
<p><span id="quiz">PMA: </span><b>For anyone reading this, please give them a word of encouragement?</b></p>
<p><span id="ans">ANNE: </span>He who began a good work in you is faithful to bring it into accomplishment....and another thing, never despise the days of a small beginning. Nathaniel asked "What good can come out of Nazareth? “Little did he know that that’s where Jesus came from? So my dear, it doesn't matter where you are, keep working hard putting God first and out of that small beginning shalt great things spring out. Your today maybe be small but your tomorrow is going to be great.</p>
