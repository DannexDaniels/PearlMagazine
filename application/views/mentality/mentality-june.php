									<p>Flying cars as we know it, is now no longer an idea of science fiction. A couple of industries, and even major aerospace firms have making effort on designs of craft you could fly around your place.</p>
									<p>Kitty Hawk, one of those companies, “drove” a flying car above a lake for about 160 kilometres, in the north of San Francisco. This is one unique prototype from the, oh, so well-known Silicon Valley.</p>
									<p>What now will we be looking for? Traffic police on air? Hey, you have a ticket for driving in the air beyond the speed of sound? Dad, I crashed into Empire building’s 40th floor? This parking airspace is for company hovercrafts only? Well, I guess we’ll find out soon enough, just as they become fine-tuned, perfected, and commercialised. </p>

								<div class="col-md-7">
									<p>Augmented Reality, or as more recognized as AR, is quite simply what we see in the movies where virtual images are superimposed on our normal eye view.</p>
									<p>Microsoft has had ideas on this, and has since made and released more than one type of glasses that offer augmented reality. Their recent release involves a sleek looking pair of glasses, you can actually be unable to tell them apart from your ordinary glasses.</p>
									<p>Suppose the police force had information on everyone, which was networked to their AR glasses, all they have to do is look at you, have the AR glasses work their magic (run a facial recognition scan), and identify someone they want. We could even have bad guys that are wanted identified with various colour. With all seriousness, we’re not too far from Robocop.</p>
									

								</div>
								<p>I shouldn’t have to ask you, to grab a pair of glasses now, do I?</p>

						</li>
						<li><span id="ans">Artificial Intelligence</span>
							<p>This is the big league. You may have heard of the now almost becoming common household names like Cortana and Siri.</p>
							<p>So, superman’s Brainiarc, or Ironman’s Jarvis, won’t look as cool as they do in the movies if they met what the real world is unfolding into. Competition would be high, and this cutting-edge technology has its screws and nuts and bolts tightened every day. </p>
							<p>These systems and machines are programmed in them to have the capacity to do various jobs, and undertake a number of engaging objectives. They can cook for you, remind you on your events, play games with you, among some myriad other abilities of theirs. They are now very able to immerse themselves in mental functions dealing with logic.</p>
							<p>While they may not feel (for now), it is only in a moment’s notice that the link will be made. Besides, how far are emotions from being mental and almost cognitive anyway?
							<p>Mom, I think I’m falling in love with Cortana.</p>
							<p>Isn’t that the computer machine thing you talk to, son?</p>

						<li><span id="ans">Advanced Charging </span>
						<p>Ever wondered if you could just have a personal dynamo that would work up the charge in the kinetic energy you spend while you walk? Well, you were very much on track.</p>
						<p>Power Felt, is a fabric fashioned in a way that can harness energy from your body and be your own electricity production unit. How it actually works is through harnessing your body heat. That’s how you’ll get to have your phones charged. Just make sure to eat enough for the both of you.</p>
						<p>On the same, there also are advance batteries, that are basically supercapacitors which keep electricity statically, this facilitates them to charge and disseminate power fast. The downside to these type of batteries is they require a large surface area, but the fast-paced development in technology will surely tell you that is just a matter of time away.</p>
						<p>Be prepared for conversations like, “Hey, my phone’s almost completely flat out, haven’t charged it for a week, just give me 10 seconds to fully charge it, then call you right back”. </p>

								<div class="col-md-7">
									<p>We owe this to a brand bracelet called, the Cicret Bracelet. You won’t have to look at your phone’s screen to access it, much less to even physically be with it. It is lightweight, stylish and you only get to wear it around your wrist. How it actually works is by having it synchronize with your phone and what remains is the display part. It has a very small picoprojector that beams light onto your arm where you get to view your phone’s contents just like that. It also has proximity sensors that provide you the interactive user interface. It is also packed with a full range of other components you would find on your phone like the accelerometer, vibrator, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, among other features.</p>
									<p>Now, you won’t ever have an excuse for missing that call. Flashing your arm up, and everything.</p>

						<li><span id="ans">Smart News Paper </span>
						<p>You may now want to consider to keep your papers for longer after you interact with one of these. Flip the page and you get to see a video of whatever occurrence you were interested to read about. You don’t need to wonder how effective that finishing hook that delivered a knockout, really was. You swipe through the information you want, tap on one, have it now displayed in the whole page.</p>
						<p>So, if you got to watch “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find them” the movie where the sorcerer flips a magazine to what we are saying and you thought that was pure fantasy, think again.</p>

						</li>
						<li><span id="ans">Portable Large Screen TV</span>
							<div class="row">
								
								<div class="col-md-7">
									<p>So, you needed to travel with friends, while still packing small and you know you would want to view that movies latest release in good quality. You couldn’t just easily carry your TV, around right? Wrong!</p>
									<p>These modern projectors are really something. Smart Beam, is a mobile projector that will work perfectly fine connected to your smartphone. Its screen can expand up to 100 inches and the projector itself is remarkably small, a cube whose dimensions are 4.5 centimetres for the width, depth and height, it also weighs an amazing 129 grams!</p>

							<div class="row">
							
								<div class="col-md-8">
									<p>I don’t want to engage myself in rigorous cloth scrubbing, wringing, and what not. The washing machine is too hard on my soft fabric too. I wonder if there’s technology that understands me.</p>
									<p>That is where this classic device comes in handy. The cool device is Dolfi, developed by MPI Ultrasonics Engineering Lab, in Switzerland. Once you put it along with your dirty clothes in your sink full of water, just add in a little detergent, and voila, your magic is done! With the latest establishments in ultrasound, you get to have your clothes washed to the very last of their fibres. It makes waves that travel through water to form tiny bubbles that implode to create millions of microjet liquid streams that rid your cloth of all dirt. This pocket-sized device with ultrasonic cleaning technology will be soft even on your most delicate clothes. No more tear from many washing cycles.</p>

						<li><span id="ans">Teleportation</span>
						<div class="row">
							<p>Okay, okay, this is a total bluff. It is still a hypothetical idea, as far as we know it. But considering you are likely reading information from glass, there can’t be anything totally written off as fictional now, can there?</p>
							<p>So, now the computers are growing smarter, and machine models are becoming incomparably stronger than flesh and bone. If our assumption that survival is for the fittest is indeed true, and shall continue to be so, then, perhaps we should run back to being the cave people we once were, as first as we can, while we still have the chance.</p>
