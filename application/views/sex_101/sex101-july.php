							<p>“It’s kinky but I fantasize a lot about bondage. I want my man to tie me up and take control of my body. I gain pleasure from the submission and the feeling of the temporary transfer of control and power,” Nadia*a friend of mine once told me. She was of course talking about her sexual fantasies which I didn’t mind but it was kinda annoying because she was telling it to the wrong person. If you want your partner to spice up the bedroom meal, then it is up to the two of you to open up and talk about your desires and fantasies.  </p>
							<p>Whether kinky, cheeky, dirty or wild, everyone has some sexual fantasy in mind that turns them on the moment they brood. So what really is a sexual fantasy? A sexual fantasy is a mental image that stirs a person’s sexuality and can create or enhance sexual arousal.  If you are an adventure couple and would love to bring an additional couple between your sheets then that is your fantasy. The greatest challenge is in turning a fantasy into a reality, this is because of the nature of some fantasies and the fact that they are subject to cultural, social, moral and religious constraints. </p>

					<p>However this should never be an excuse for a couple not to liven their sex lives, sex can turn out to be super boring especially in a long lasting relationship when a couple sticks to the norm.  The scenarios for sexual fantasies vary greatly between individuals in a relationship and are influenced by personal desires and experiences. They tend to range from the mundane to the bizarre and it is therefore important to have a discussion with your partner in order to agree on which sexual fantasy you would like to turn into a reality as a couple.  We are going to have a look at some of the common sexual fantasies that a couple can easily turn into a reality.</p>

								<li><p><strong>Sex in a public place: </strong>Just as the name suggests, this sexual fantasy is all about having sex in the open. The feeling of being caught adds to the fantasy and may lead both of you to the utmost level of orgasm. “ I have this weird fantasy of making out in public since I don’t mind being watched but it is obviously not possible in Kenya” Rukia* one of the people I spoke to confessed. If you are a Kenyan, you have probably heard of the Masinde Muliro garden saga where a couple were arrested for making love in public. But what if they were just fulfilling their sexual fantasy? This leads us to the question of where? Where can you have sex in public and not be arrested? A fantasy is just an imagination that can be fulfilled by mind play. You can make your bedroom more public, this will give you both the feeling of being watched. Open the curtains and whisper to each other how all the neighbors are watching, how some are wishing they were her and turn the lights on at night. In such a case, your imagination is your super power; make a good use of it.</p></li>

								<li><p><strong>The threesome: </strong>Most of the people I spoke to have this sexual fantasy; they have this wild desire to add a person in their bedroom. Two women and a man perhaps? , or two men and a woman? Whatever the case…this is the fantasy of many couples out there. You are probably one of those people who can’t stand your girlfriend speaking to another man but what if she is dreaming about two hot males (the like of Nick Mutuma) fighting over her body and attention. How can you make this a reality for her? You can use some sex toys to create a feeling of the threesome during regular sex but this is only if you can’t bring an actual person. If you are okay with the idea then as a couple you should agree on the person you want to bring in. Both of you should be okay with him or her. When the time comes, use some wine to break the ice Create a great sexual atmosphere, be comfortable, share the attention equally but if the guest is a man; give the lady the most attention. Make the best put of this and you will definitely do it again.</p></li>

								<li><p><strong>Master and slave: </strong>This was the perfect sexual fantasy by many couples I spoke to. “I love to try out the crazy” Dennis*said “I want to be a strict teacher and my partner a submissive student. This is a man who likes her lady cuffed while he works on her. It gives him a feeling of being control, he is the boss giving and taking away her pleasure. The point of this fantasy is to make sure the ‘slave’ understands who the boss is and that they cannot do anything. Since the ‘master’ is the boss, they must be tough and leave fear and shyness outside the bedroom. This role is not for the timid partner because you have to let your temptations take over. The ‘slave’ should be the partner who derives pleasure from the feeling of helplessness and immobility and the ‘master’ deriving satisfaction from seeing the partner tied up. This is a fantasy worth trying. Find out who are the master and slave of your sex life.</p></li>

					</ul>
					<p>These sexual fantasies can truly change your sex life forever. If things are getting boring, bring up the subject and this will probably save not only your sex life but your relationship. The secret in a sexual fantasy is to chose the right one and do it the right way. It has the ability to give people roles they would normally not have, such as power, innocence and guilt. Making sexual fantasies a reality is something a couple should try out since it has enormous influence over sexual behavior and can be the SOLE cause of an orgasm.</p>
