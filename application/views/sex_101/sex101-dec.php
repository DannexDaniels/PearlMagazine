					<p>It’s the festive season and the air is sizzling with the good, better and best of offers and food aroma. Today, I have an ‘offer’ for your sex life too but if you end up loving it I’m sure you will consider it a gift. For those who are lucky to spend this festive season with their lovers and are worried on the kind of gift they are going to get them, don’t you worry because I have got you covered. </p>

							<p>In my case we are going to gift your lover a special, steamy and sensual bedroom-style present. This is the time of the year where you re-ignite that sexual flame that was near dead due to the crap that the world can throw your way. You may be wondering what is wrong with the both of you but it is normal to lose the sexual spark as the best part is in reigniting it. Every relationship has its fair share of ups and downs. You can’t always be on a sexual high. It is however sweet and exhilarating when both of you decide to make a kick-start to your sex life.</p>
							<p> I want to say that you should invite me to watch but I don’t want to look like a pervert because trust me it’s an awesome experience. So let’s take a look at the ways in which we can give this holiday season…after all, the holiday season is all about giving. Whether you are giving it in front of the fireplace, out in the woods, under the Christmas tree, inside the car, in the kitchen counter or in the showers it doesn’t matter as long as it’s as sweet as I already pictured it will be.</p>

					<p>The sexual spark is usually killed by routine and boredom. Can you just imagine having sex and your mind whispers “holy crap I’m so bored.” Who gets bored during sex if not those couples whose sexual spark has been killed? Sex to them has become a routine and even initiating one makes them feel like they are trying to move a mountain. Sex is supposed to be playful and fun, bring creativeness and a little craziness in it. Try intimate touches in new and public places, under the table in restaurant, on a secluded beach, in the elevator…in the car. </p>
					
					<p>That craziness adds to the excitement and playfulness that leads to increased intimacy and connection. Trust me by the time you are indoors there will be no need for foreplay as he/she will be ready for the next step. If it’s your man tease him until all he wants is to ravish you. Make a rule of no touching during the day, then walk around with that sexy lingerie, eat that chocolate like it’s him you’re devouring, dance to your favorite song in that booty shot that makes your ass look like a snack. Your aim is to make him want you the more, touch yourself and let him watch, you can even show what you would like to be done to you when you finally allow him to touch you. You can give her a massage, touch her in all the right places but never allow her to ‘cum’ until she is literally begging for it.</p>

							<p>Sexual spark always simmers when we feel like we know our partners and that there is no new thing we can do with them but that is where we go wrong. Re-imagine and recreate the passion in you. That is the most important component of intimacy. When you begin dating, you crave every cranny part of your partner’s body and soul but eventually this dies down and you have to imagine new ways to connect and that is what you will be doing this season. What are some of the recent fantasies you’ve had? When you have both answered that question share with your partner and explore fantasies together. Help each other cross out the list in your fantasies. If you have always wanted to introduce a sex toy in your bedroom, then agree on which one and make sure you’re both comfortable with it, then use it to bring back the passion. If you want to try a new style you watched in porn, then why not? Make use of it in a way that you're both fully sated when done. If you want to play the naughty maid and the boss who is a sexual god then go ahead. </p>

					<p>Role playing is one of the best ways to get your lover sexually excited especially if you’ve been with them for a while and sex has gone stale. Imagine to be a personality that you admire, it brings the connection and passion with fire. Blindfold her and touch her while avoiding her hot spots, when you finally touch the spots that are craving your lips, she will explode into a fit of desire. What could be a better gift than a mind-blowing orgasm? Set the sexual mood. You don’t just expect to argue with your partner and have sex with them the next moment. Sex is in the mind and so that is where both of you need to focus on this holiday before making your partner either hard or wet. Enjoy an evening at the balcony in each other’s arm listening to that old school music you both love. Prepare your favorite dish together and during the day send each other little love reminders to build your anticipation. </p>
					<p>The secret to doing these is to ensure you are both imagining what is eventually coming your way and that is some hot sex. You can also hone your pillow talk. Good conversation helps to keep things alive in the bedroom. If you ever have to argue then do it somewhere else as the bedroom should be used to amp your sexual passion. Communication is the most effective way of making sure you both feel fulfilled. </p>
					<p>Finally as much as reigniting the sexual spark can be frustrating and demanding, don’t force issues, feelings and sex because it will just push you further apart. If you don’t like something, speak up. Desperations and neediness are major turn-offs to both sexes so your goal is to take things slow and sweet until you have reached the phase where you both want it hard and fast. Sex is in the mind as much as it involves body parts. If both your minds aren’t present within the sexual experience then bringing the passion back will be so hard. With much said the gift is in your hands, happy holidays as you get to wrap it and present it to your partner.</p>
