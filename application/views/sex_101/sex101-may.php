						<h2>Does 'SIZE' really matter?</h2>

							<p>A recent research conducted by famous controversial scientist Richard Lynn in over 113 countries worldwide, has proved that African men have largest penis in the world.  At the top of the list is The Republic of Congo, followed by Ghana and later on South Africa.  Even while African countries top the list, it’s not a guarantee that every African man’s penis is 8inch, some of our brothers are below 4.5 inches and this begs the question: Does Size Really Matter? </p>
							<p>According to a study done by UCLA, only …… percent of the world male population has a penis eight inches long.  About 70 percent of the males' range from six - six and a quarter Inches. Hence, most of the time women are always dealing with an average penis in the normal world. </p>
							<p>As much as a man may have a small penis, a research done by Dr.Ed, show that many women don’t mind the size but the skill.  Most of the time, you’ll find a girl excited about a bone only to find it’s a fragile one.  The next time she sees a small bone and gives up on it before the sex but it leaves her speechless. </p>

					<p>A big penis particularly above six inches always looks like an adventurous and fun idea but most of the time it isn’t. A woman’s vagina runs from 4 to 6 inches deep depending on her height and weight.  So a penis that is around 5 to 6 inches long should always do the trick because an 8 inch penis will touch her cervical wall making it a painful affair.</p>
					<p>However, another research done by Rutgers University found that women who prefer vaginal penile sex over other types of sex prefer men whose size is slightly large than the average size. Women who also prefer or like vaginal orgasm also prefer men with a big penis.  But this is a small majority of women. </p>
					<p>In comparison to length, many women opt for width. According to a study done by psychologist Russel Eisenman, a wider penis provides greater clitoris stimulation during sexual intercourse. It also goes to great lengths of stimulating the outer walls of the vagina which is an area key for orgasms in women. </p>

					<p>While the debate of size will always be an endless one with science and research showing inconclusive results, the answer trickles down to the person engaging in the act. Do I like that size? Does it stimulate and satisfy me sexually?  That seals the deal.  While I may prefer slightly above average, you might prefer an average size that is thick enough. </p>
					<p>So because his ego is a fragile one and he needs to be reassured that he’s man enough, always be kind.  If it’s big go girl call him daddy.  If it’s small but makes you lose your breath and chokes you with pleasure let him know the size doesn’t matter because his skill is on point and my oh my! The next time you’ll get between the sheets…You’ll thank me later</p>
