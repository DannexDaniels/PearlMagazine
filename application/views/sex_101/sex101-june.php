							<p>There are some things we can’t just get enough of and others we can definitely do without. Have you ever thought about the fact that you might be having too much of something? One of the most common concerns of couples in relationships is the frequency of sex. How many times should a couple engage in sexual  Activity in a month or even a year? What is too much sex in a relationship? When it comes to sex most people like to assume that their horizons are unlimited. But are we really telling the truth about the amount of sex we can handle or even how much we want to have?</p>

					<p>According to <strong>The Kinsey Institute</strong> 18-29 year olds have sex 112 times per year. On average 30-39 year olds have it 86 times per year and 69 times per year for those aged 40 and above. Right now you are probably doing a calculation in your head to determine if you’re consuming too much of your partner’s fruit. Before you come into a conclusion let us put other factors into consideration.</p>
 					<p>The question of how much is too much sex can be easily compared to the consumption of alcohol; it is not a matter of how much you drink but a matter of how the alcoholic drink affects your life. If alcohol is turning your life into a mess then you might want to tone down your drinking. This also is how sex works. </p>
 					<p>If frequent sexual activity with your partner makes you watch porn at work or masturbate at any given free time then sex has led to your loss of control. At that point it would be advisable to rehabilitate yourself matters sex and reduce your consumption. If you are also one of those people who prioritize sex over other important activities in your life like attending meetings, classes, visiting friends or making it to a doctor’s appointment, then you could be suffering from hyper sexuality. Some will even continue with the behavior of hyper sexuality in the face of negative consequences.</p>

							<p>My interaction with some friends gave an insight on what they consider as too much sex. *Lora said that extreme frequency of sexual intercourse led to the damage of her vaginal skin. Penetration becomes agony as the vaginal skin is cut and usually has wounds. This led to a decision to reduce her sexual escapades…she says it has had a great effect on her sexlife. </p>
 							<p>“My girlfriend used to complain of pain during sex and it was a complete turn off for us” *Mark, a friend says. “It was not until we were advised to reduce the frequency of our sexual activities that we knew what the problem was. We now have great sexual experiences.” Dr. Stephen Snyder an M.D and a sexual therapist in New York City says that when a man ejaculates 8-10 times over a weekend it may lead to pain and discomfort. He also cautions that wounds and cuts that result from hyper sexual activity increases the chances of one contracting sexually transmitted infections and other illness.</p>

					<p>However Jonathan D. Schiff an M.D at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City says “If the amount of sex you’re having works for you and is not causing you or your partner any problems or distress, then your sexual frequency is just fine and do not let anyone tell you anything different.”</p>
 					<p>It is therefore clear that as long as you are having psychological and physically healthy sex, then the quantity doesn’t matter. If the sex is taking you somewhere special and making you feel great about yourself but is having a negative impact on you, then it might just be too much. It is the quality not the quantity that matters. So how about you tell that guy who keeps boasting of how long he can last but does a shitty job to improve on how he does the work.</p>
