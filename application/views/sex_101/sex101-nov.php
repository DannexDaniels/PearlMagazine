						<h2>The Controversial Big ‘O’ and Sexual Pleasure</h2>
						<p><em>Story By: Akinyi D. Osongo</em></p>

					<p>Making a partner feel great can be deeply pleasurable especially with men who are into women; this is a particular big turn-on to them, as they want to ensure that the women in their arms have mind-blowing orgasms. When a woman orgasms’, it is known to boost the male sexual ego of their partner. But this rarely happens and that’s why presumably many straight women out there fake it. </p>
					<p>I am not going to give you a long lecture on why you deserve to orgasm as woman. I care less if you orgasm or not, the main deal is; are you enjoying the sex? Or is the sex worse that you feel like one who is being raped and you just have to fake the orgasm in order to get him of you? “I just wanted to end it”, one of the ladies I spoke to gave this as the reason why she keeps faking orgasms. I am not one to judge but come on, I don’t think this has any difference with rape because the only person I would like to come out as fast as they went in is- a rapist. Sex is about the pleasure and the connection not about the pressure of orgasms.</p>
					<p>Several of the women I interviewed faked their orgasms because they were just tired or did not want to seem like they were uninterested in sex. The interesting few faked orgasms because the faking helped them to orgasm for real; for them, the means justifies the end! The sound of their voice was a turn on to them not because they were having an orgasm but because they were enjoying the sex, this enjoyment according to them, is what gives mind blowing orgasms. </p>

							<p>An orgasm is not the be-all-end-all for these women, what matters most is that she has a partner who is attentive and responsive to her. For a man to be attentive and responsive in bed there must be good sexual communication. Faked orgasms are an indication of bad communication between sexual partners. One lady said, “I used to fake orgasms until one day I confessed to my lover that I cannot come through penetration only, I needed clitoral stimulation. From then on we have been having great sex.” She said. It is thus clear that if you fake once and he thinks what he is doing is working; he will continue to do what he thinks will work next time. On the other hand, if something feels good, the woman should give her partner the attention and affection so that even non-verbally the man will understand and reinforce the act.</p>

					<p>Communication is thus a great tool to use in order to have a great sexual experience. If you are not sure of her sensitive spots then ask her about them. Tell her how you are enjoying the great sex of late and ask her what she thinks can be done to make it even better. Communication during sex is also very important; especially when you are getting to know each other’s particular pleasure. A woman knows her own body, so when she tells you to touch here, speed things up or slow them down then pay attention to her. If she wants a certain position, take the hint, make her happy and she won’t have to fake the pleasure.</p>

					<p>Just like I said at the beginning an orgasm is not the key to great sex. Women across the divide can still enjoy sex without having the big O.</p>
					<p>Connection is another vital ingredient of a hot served sexual encounter. Most women will reach an orgasm easily with someone they feel a connection with. If a certain level of trust has been established, a woman will feel relaxed in the arms of her partner, resulting in enjoyable and satisfying sex. Most of the times the enjoyable and satisfying aspect, is all that takes for your woman to orgasm. </p>

							<p>This connection is not achieved only in bed, but in the way you treat your woman during the day. If you are an arrogant lover who doesn’t care about her ladies feeling then do not expect an excited and loving woman in bed. Talk to her, tell her how well that blue dress flatters her sexy figure, tell her how you love to lick her clitoris and play with those tender nipples. Ensure she is aroused and thinking of you in her even before you touch her. Appreciate her meals; appreciation is a sure turn on for most women. In all senses ensure she is into you before you are into her.</p>

							<p>Do not be lied to that looks do not matter, that how you look is not significant in your sexual life as what the eye sees is what ends up stimulating the brain and the body. At some point, in every relationship, things get comfortable and we start to let things go including our physical appearance. A woman forgets to take care of her body and indulges in decadent desserts; the man frequently skips the gym and develops a beer gut. Well, all these things do in fact have an impact on our desire for one another and can definitely dampen a woman’s fire; she may fake orgasms instead of hurting his feelings. A man may also just come because he is inside you and not because you are having any great impact to his feelings. Your body is your lover’s sexual tool, and the best thing to do in order to win this war is to take good care of it.</p>

					<p>Sexual pleasure thus depends on the above factors and how great a couple utilizes them. An orgasm is a result of the combined factors, and not only how hard a guy can pump into you as most men assume. Women want sexual pleasure, they want to feel like they are not being used between the sheets but that they are also having a great time. Give your woman a great time in bed and you will have not to worry about whether she orgasms or not. The power is in your hands.</p>
