						<h2>MOTHER'S DAY</h2>
						<p>No fake zone</p>
					</header>
					
					<p><strong>Mother's Day </strong>is a one day celebration honoring the mother of the family, and the influence of mothers in society. It is celebrated in over 40 countries across the globe on various days, most commonly in the months of March or May. In Kenya, on the eleventh of this month (May) we will be celebrating mother’s day. We show pure love and genuine care towards mothers on this day. </p>

							<p>In line with mother’s day and other days that we have set aside as International days to mark an important occassion, I think we should have a world ‘let’s all be real' day. The age and the social media era has taken away from us who we truly are and what we truly deserve to be.  It has instead brought with it, be who you think will please them and go green with envy.  Be what will make them want your life so bad and wish they were you.  Be expensive, have taste, be a diva or part of the ‘cheers baba' squad.  In short be FAKE.</p>
							<p>There is a life on Instagram and snap chat that might make you think you are not in the same country with our so called ‘divas’.  They are walking brands.  Fendi shoes, Givenchy dresses, Gucci bags and virgin human hair.  Oh! A super big iPhone on the table, flawless make up and matte lipstick.  They are always in high-end hotels holding wine glasses with hash tags like ‘#work flow!’  Which work sister?  Do you even know what work is?  Work is sweating it out in your respective career field, stretching boundaries, breaking the glass ceiling, making a name for yourself and inspiring other people. </p>
							<p>We all know what modelling is.  It’s what Tyra banks, Leila lopes, Alek Wek and Ajuma Nasenyana do.  What you do is high end prostitution, going for photo shoots, posting up semi nudes for prospective buyers to sample the goods. While the likes of former Tv siren Cynthia Nyamai have made it their business to come up with strategies that see their clients ascend to power as presidents all you do is sell waist trainers, bleaching concoctions and booty poppers.</p>

					<p>After a week of advertising your business on Instagram you need a break, a vacation so to speak.  Instead of going to see your mother in the village and donating some of your money to schools so that girls can get an education and not end up like you, all you do is fly out. </p>

							<p>First Class, on a foreign airline all the way to Burj Al Arab, where the presidential suite costs one million shillings a night.  Just so we are clear how did you afford it?  Flat tummy herbal tea costs 1000 Bob to 3000 Bob how many do you have to sell in order to afford a vacation after balancing the books, paying rent and ordering for new stock?  Honestly if it was your business funding your trips, the only trip you would have made is to Odeon treat yourself to fries (those who’ve been there know what I mean) and head back to work.  So the next time you post up a picture of you in a sky scraper in Dubai, please, remember to also post up the pictures of Ahmed, Kassim and Patel who will pay for your return ticket. </p>
							<p>Then came man as a narcist, born by the media.  They drive Subaru’s,  wear shades of blue suits,  brown shoes,  happy socks,  leather wallets with pretty much their national identification cards in there.  Over the weekend they are the ballers. They have to go out of town maybe ‘Naxvegas’ or Naivasha.  They wear side pocket checked knee length shorts, rugby T-shirts and sunny caps or they will be in sweat pants, white socks and plastic Adidas flip flops.</p>

					<p>A cheers ‘baba’ boy will always talk about his plans. Plans to quit work…how will you pay for the loan that bought your car?  Plans to start a business, with what money if together with your 15 boys you do a harambee to buy Jameson? Plans to settle down, why are you lying to yourself when you have not even been friend zoned the best you’ve achieved is ‘bro zone'and maybe a bedroom errand boy disposable any minute? All they ever do is plan to make plans and tell everyone, “my guy I am telling you we kunywad till we fikad that place.”</p>
					<p>I wish all these could disappear so that on that ‘International let’s all be real day’ would all be true.  Wake up skip the shower, rub your eyes, chew mint to give you fresh breath, make up free so that even your village elders can recognize you, band let your natural hair with stunted growth that you’ve always hidden beneath Brazilian get some sun.  On this day sister girl you’ll breath well since you won’t be suffocating yourself in a waist trainer and body suits trying to tuck in your tummy.  You’ll eat samosas and chips ‘mwitu' and greet people like you used to do in the village before you came to the city to be a Nairobi diva.  The cheers baba squad can freely suck empire out of those plastic bags and have ‘motura' with the boys.  Laugh at who the hot pepper is choking to tears and later on watch a game at the video stall you used to watch in before you took a loan and bought your flat-screen. </p>
					<p>Will this day ever come? I don’t know.  Let’s keep our fingers crossed because I know just like me you’d like to live in a world where people are true to themselves. </p>
