            <h2>Diamond Platnumz Unplugged</h2>
            <p><em>Story By: Sibuor Madhako</em></p>

          <p>Ahem! Come closer, we need to talk. This conversation is long overdue. I promise I won’t take up much of you time. Ten maybe fifteen minutes and I will be done. Just the other day, Hamisa Mobetto one of Tanzania’s ‘successful models’ was pregnant but that is not news. The news is that she was pregnant for Diamond Simba Platinumz. But still, that is no news compared to the fact that diamond distanced himself from the allegation that he had sired Hamisa’s child. When you thought it ends there, it doesn’t. Diamonds mom visits Hamisa in hospital but again, this is Africa, we all visit moms and their newborns.</p>
          <p>Then the news was that Simba went on a radio station and owned up that he is the father. But here is my problem, he says he gave Hamisa monthly upkeep and even bought her a car to shut her up. Is that the value of a person to you? He didn’t want to break his family so he claims, what are condoms for? Why did he get involved with her if he knew he was married? He says, “Shetani aliniingia!” (the devil made me to…) see, he had to find an excuse, he had to distance himself from the mistake. He had to christen himself. He played the victim card so well. You, netizens were not left behind, diamond played a tune and you all danced to it.</p>

          <p>Many went online, ranting, accusing Hamisa of being immoral, manner less, classless, a cheat, some even called her trash. But hey hold up, in the picture diamond is in bed with Hamisa, the man is deep asleep. He did a good job the previous night. The sex was good, maybe rejuvenating. That is why he was asleep like a baby when the picture was taken. Two, the sex didn’t happen once, that at least we know. It happened one too many times, and he did not stop. He kept going for more and more until out of ‘love’ a baby was conceived. There is no police statement anywhere that prove he was sexually abused. He was the man, hitting his ‘wife’, Hamisa and God knows who else. No wonder they call him SIMBA.</p>
          <p>Why did we not point fingers at him? Why did we not tell him what he did was wrong? He is a married man right, why did he not stay true and faithful to his wife? Why did he not think of his children, his image, his finances, why? As a society why are we not holding to account the real criminals and calling out on the wrong behavior? If he had not made himself available, Hamisa would’ve never ‘crawled’ into his world.</p>
          <p>It’s very easy in this society to blasphemies women and christen men. Well hello, it takes two to tango. We defended him and now he has gotten away with it and it won’t be long before he does it again. Oh I see, the look on your face, you doubt me right? Look at Kevin Hart, do I need to say more? No, yeah you now see my point right? Good.</p>
          <p>According to Nene Simon, the role of artists is to reflect the times that we are living in for they are the mirror of any given society. So, if our artists keep thriving on moral filth as the foundation of their art, then we are on a highway to hell. If we keep glorifying men for sleeping around like cockerels on steroids and crucifying women for getting pregnant for it then we are riding at full speed on an expressway to a deep dark sea that if we don’t brake and retrace our footsteps, it’s only a matter of time and we will be destroyed.</p>
          <p><strong>PS; Dear sister girl, Karma is bitch. You may run so fast and think you are far enough but when you pause to catch your breath, it will catch up with you and bite you in the ass.</strong> Ask Eniko, it took eight years, and when she her fairytale was almost having a happy ending karma struck. How about miss Zee, loads of vacation, love on the internet, two kids to show for it, an ‘engagement ring’ but just before the wedding…………..</p>
