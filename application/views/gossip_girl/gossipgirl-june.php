							<p>We all knew Vera Sidika as the dark girl with a big derrière until photos of her, fifty shades lighter surfaced on the internet. We all went crazy, giving her names like Vera Si'jik'a but after a while we let her be and we thought we are now proud of our melanin till the real OG decided according to Octopizzo ‘kujitoa rangi'</p>
							<p>I used to like the previous OG, not so tall, dark, yes very dark, the good kind of dark that makes you want a guy and handsome, umh let’s just say lookable. The tattoos blended well with the skin, made him more gangster. His presence in his videos gave them some seriousness. For example his hit song Mazishi, hard lyrics that we barely hear nothing because he somehow lived abroad in his dreams growing up and now he’s living that dream. We see a dark guy, really dark guy and he just sets the mood for the song.</p>
							<p>Problem is unlike Vera who has no problem shouting on top of the world how costly the skin lightening, (actually, bleaching…lightening is just an overrated way of saying it), the real OG, won’t hear anything about it. According to him, dark people are broke, walk in the sun, drink dirty water and cannot afford facial scrubs! His girlfriend introduced him to scrubs; he can afford bottled sparkling water and drives around Nairobi like a boss.</p>

							<p>I wonder though, why are his hands darker? Is it only his face that is always chauffeured around and the rest of the body walks in the sun? The clean water he drinks is yet to trickle down to his other body parts? And the scrubs, oh by the time he’s done he’ll be giving Huddah a run for her money. He has stood his ground. It’s not bleaching…Oops skin lightening! He terms it as ‘better living.’</p>
							<p>While many of us tweeted calling him Julius Yellow, deep down we are also suffering from great insecurities. The difference between us and the OG is that he had the courage to go forth and ‘drink clean water.’ He thought and thought through it and decided irrespective of all the trolling he’d go through he will still go ahead and do his facial scrubs.</p>
							<p>What have you ever wanted to do but you are holding back because of people, what will they say how will they look at me? Want to start a business create a plan and go ahead. Enroll for Masters, save up a little cash and start class. Date that broke guy who makes you feel good about yourself, Darling, they don’t have to know. Wake up, dress up, slay up and stay true to who you are. Whatever you want to do, go forth and do it.</p>
