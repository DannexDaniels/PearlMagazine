							<p>In the last three months, mega international superstars have thronged our country. Kenya has become the ideal hub for foreign artists to come and make a fortune for themselves. We are the ultimate destination for these artists riding high on music half of the time we struggle to understand. First it was Chris brown, then Omarion, then Jason Derulo, Jidenna and many more are set to come and perform.</p>
							<p>Don’t get me wrong, I don’t have a problem with foreign art. It’s good for diversity. It gives art color and variety. There will always be a wide range to choose from depending with the circumstances. It’s also good for competition. International art raises the bar. This can be seen in various ways from the content in the art, casting, directing, photography, videography, fashion and much more. Finally the presence of foreign artists in the country sets stage for our local artists to get an opportunity to meet, interact and even do collaborations with these stars.</p>
							<p>The one thing that seems to concern me is the humongous gate fee that is always smacked on the faces of those with intentions to attend these concerts. From 3k, 5k, 7k, 10k, 15k, 20k, 25 up to 30k. As good people who love and appreciate art, we comfortably cough these notes and make our ways into these arenas of fame. We flood our timelines with pictures from these high end events, document them on snap chat and enjoy our fifteen seconds of fame. Tomorrow, back to being broke but hey didn’t we have fun? (Idiots). Anything for the high end life. We must be cool, we must slay, we must wakilishaa (say in Nairobi light skin girls tone).</p>

							<p>My problem is we are so engrossed in being the cool gang at the expense of local art. How much does it cost to attend a show by Kenyan artists? Minimum 100 shillings, maximum 1000 maybe?. Lucky you if the charge is 1000 bob. Most of the time even its always a group of artists maybe three which translates to 300 Bob if you equally divide the cash among the three performing artists. We have cheapened our own art and are glorifying foreign art. Very few would pay three thousand shillings to attend a Kenyan festival, even if a couple of artists will be there. The main question always is, ‘three k kwani ‘nani'(-international artists) anakuja? Not unless it’s for a foreign act,  many cannot. Truth is, in this high end concerts you barely get the value for your 20,000, ask the people who went to Mombasa!</p>
							<p>With very little in their pockets, how do we expect artists to live off their art? Let alone their personal bills, content creation is an expensive endeavor. One pays through their nose for studio sessions and splits themselves into two to shoot a video. After a good song has been released, we want to pay 300 shillings, how is this artist supposed to keep rolling out music? Then we will say Kenyan art is not worth? How is he to pay a good producer and shoot a standard video? We also say they are lazy! What will he eat? The Snapchat videos from your high end international star concert? He has gone to look for a job so that he doesn’t die of hunger trying to sing to life a dead corpse lying in the morgue!</p>

					<p>The situation is not bound to change if we don’t change our attitude. Let us get excited about our artists like we do with foreign artists. Let us flood their concerts, download their music, subscribe to their channels, and keep them on their toes to keep improving their art. Let us dignify art by paying substantial amounts at the gate. Artists are human too, they have bills and needs too and art is their fulltime job. Why is Kenya the ultimate dream destination of every artist but hell to Kenyan artists? In the words of Victoria Kimani, “book us now while you can still afford us and pay us substantial amounts like you pay international acts,”- because soon if our artists work hard enough, they will be international and stars doing international tours and we will not be afford them.</p>
