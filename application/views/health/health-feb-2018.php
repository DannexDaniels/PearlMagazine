        <p>As the world becomes more modernized and globalized, it is becoming more liberal as well. More youths than would be thought are engaging in premarital sexual activities, with or without consent from their partners. This nightmare remains interestingly under-explored, especially in developing countries. </p>
        <p>A section of youths and adolescents admit to being sexually active, yet equipped with minute knowledge of the implications of this act, and what is held for them at the other end. The overall health of any adolescent depends majorly on the level and quality of education, coupled with credible management of health and access to health services. </p>
        <p>These resources remain scanty in most areas, and the access to education becomes more undermined among most youths and their parents. Forum for African Women Educationalists (FAWE), a non-governmental organization forged to empower African women cites lack of education as the major cause of ignorance on matters of sexuality among most adolescents. In lieu to this, they go into sexuality quite unaware of what it is all about. </p>

<p>Sheila* an eighteen year old mother of two, lives in shame as she recounts the events that led to her pregnancy. She was eleven years old when her father threatened to marry her off, prompting her to run away from home, into a children’s home in her region. (Locations and names withheld for privacy purposes.) To imagine she had left her home into salvation, here she fell prey to the managing director of the home, who after finding out of her pregnancy, chased her away from the home, with an accusation of ‘cruelty to other children and indiscipline.’ Going back home was not an option. With this pregnancy, she took to prostitution, while sleeping on the streets on the days she got no clients. “I was sexually active even before I was eleven. I first had sex when I was ten years old.” She recounts. On inquiring whether she was aware of the implications, she admits that she is only aware of ‘HIV/AIDS’. Her twins are now six years old, and she lives with her mother in a rental house at the village market. </p>
<p>Such predicaments and worse are encountered by young souls, who remain unaware of the implications of such risky behavior. While more people who are supposed to guard them make them their prey, adolescent boys and girls are being converted into sex slaves. More referral hospitals in Kenya report of adolescent abortions that go beyond those that are known of. An advocacy for sexual health rights therefore becomes a necessity, as its lack may cause greater negative impact to future generations’ health and overall existence. </p>

        <p>About one third of Kenya’s population is made up of youths, according to the 2009 populations and Housing Census. Thus, the protection of this population is important for the sake of the future of the country and the world in general. Reproductive health is divided into various age groups and the rights are grouped based on these groupings. The Adolescent Reproductive Health and Development Policy (2003) guards Adolescent Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (ASRH&R) as an important component. Based on this, it is important for any individual to take up the initiative to protect these components, and save a generation from overly destroying itself. </p>

<p>It is a goal of all residents of a state to improve the knowledge of adolescents about reproductive health, encourage positive and healthy responses and attitudes towards sexuality, delay the onset of participation in sexual acts for adolescents, decrease the possibility of risky behavior among those adolescents that are already active and provide areas that are youth-friendly, where trained personnel and peer educators can be accessed by these youths. </p>
<p>Guard the sexual and reproductive health rights of adolescents for a better future. Educate adolescents on their sexuality. More knowledge is power. Ignorance is also no defense. </p>
