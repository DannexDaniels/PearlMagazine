							<p>It would take Sheila*, a period of one month to find out that she was going down the drain owing to depression. When her relationship with her long-time boyfriend ended two years ago, she found it hard to get accustomed to it. She resulted to seclusion and lone time, locking herself in her room for long hours and alienating herself from the world. She would maintain her position at the desk at work all day and leave straight for home when work was done. </p>
							<p>“I am usually introverted. It was nothing new that I was quiet at work. It took my best friend almost three weeks to find out I was not well when she visited. Secluding myself made me feel content. I had found solace in my own torment. My thoughts became my safe-haven. I lost interest in all things that were fun to me before it ended.” She says. Sheila suffered bouts of adverse painful thoughts for a record four weeks. At the homestretch of it all, she was ready to take her life. “I was ready to die. It was the only solution I could come up with at that time.” She came to in the ICU ward of the Aga Khan Hospital, Nairobi, four days after she had taken an overdose of tranquillizers to take her life. </p>

							<p>Clinical depression consumes the possible energy the patient may have. They feel lonely, and unwanted. Suicide thoughts torment them, and as hard as one may be to control it, they may eventually take their lives. Clinical Depression may be categorized as mild, moderate or severe. If the cases of depression are periodic and repetitive, it is referred to as Recurrent Depressive Disorder. A kind of depression that displays both manic and depressive periods separated by periods of normal mood is referred to as Bipolar Affective Disorder. Mostly, specific symptoms of depression include: loss of interest or pleasure, sadness, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, disturbed sleep patterns, disturbed appetite, continued fatigue and poor attention. However, these do not mean that a person is depressed. If they extend over a period of several days, then it is a cause for alarm.  </p>

						<p>A person may be unaware of the onset of clinical depression. They stick in denial and may mostly speak in ways to suggest that they are unaware of their self.  Medical practitioners believe that depression is majorly contributed to by the effects of our social environment including family, friendship and romantic relationships. It comes along due to the inability to accept and deal with these circumstances in favorable manner. It may be seen as a common and rising problem among us and in people from all social hierarchies.  </p>

					<h3>Treatment of clinical depression</h3>
					<p>Treating clinical depression needs dedication and time. A number of methods and therapies may be applied to this course including lifestyle changes, social support, counseling, and nutrition, sleep and stress reduction. While these may be enough to reverse a mild case of depression, medical therapy is a crucial intervention in addition to the ones named above. In some cases, full rehabilitation and seclusion is needed in the management of post-depression patients. It is also possible to guide management of the condition through distraction activities such as physical exercise, hobbies and outdoor activities. </p>
