<p><b>How many times do we stretch out our hands greet people and ask for their name? Contrary to that, we live in a society where we label people hoes and hoe officially becomes their middle name.</b></p>

<p>How many times do we pause and ask people how they are doing and what their name is? More often than not, we are quick to judge. We quickly assess them. We do a thorough profiling of these people. We put together the negatives we perceive of them. Based on the stereotypes of people we’ve seen or heard, we cast the dice. Boom, we give them a name. However, it’s important to note that the name we give them is not their real name. Don’t believe? Here are scenarios we’ve given names to people.</p>
<p>She is a media personality. She anchors news on certain allocated days. She is bold and beautiful. To you she is unreachable. She is a girl you fancy, like or admire, maybe a girl you’d like to meet. The sad bit is that she is so close yet so far away. She is always in your leaving room but she is just on TV. What you don’t know about her is how many battles she is fighting, how she soaked her previous outfit in tears. You don’t know how scared she is always of taking risks. Have you heard her laugh? Has she told you how many late nights and early mornings she has had to work to rise through the ranks?</p>
<p>All you have ever had is the nasty stuff. You have heard about how all that there is to her is just a pretty face with a cute smile. You have heard about how lazy she is. How she is not intelligent. You have heard about how she has slept her way to the top. You have heard about all she does is sleep with old ugly rich men who finance her fancy lifestyle. You have heard how she ruined her marriage and many more?</p>

        <p>All you have ever had is the nasty stuff. You have heard about how all that there is to her is just a pretty face with a cute smile. You have heard about how lazy she is. How she is not intelligent. You have heard about how she has slept her way to the top. You have heard about all she does is sleep with old ugly rich men who finance her fancy lifestyle. You have heard how she ruined her marriage and many more?</p>
        <p>However, have you heard she is a mom? Yes to either a handsome boy or a beautiful girl. Have you heard she was once a wife and battled demons which half would kill us? Have you heard she is a survivor who conquered so much in life? Have you heard she has a degree and is fully qualified for her job? Ah have you heard she takes risks, makes investments and creates job opportunities for other people? Giving people a decent way of earning a living? Yes that’s is her story, that is who she is. It’s sad that one person has labeled her a hoe and we have officially made hoe her middle name.</p>

<p>Next time you meet her, I know it’s hard, but, rig your mind off any bias opinion you might have. She is human, standing right in front of you. Do not give her a name without truly getting to know her. Stretch out your hand and say hello, how are you? My name is……….. What is yours?</p>
<p><b>PS: </b><em>have you heard she also human and has a heart, she craves for love too. She wants to be cared for deeply and genuinely. She also has other needs that you also have so don’t judge her harshly when she chooses which poison will kill her softly but sweetly.</em></p>
